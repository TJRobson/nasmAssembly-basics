# Learning About NASM Assembly

#### Disclaimer
---
I have no intention of taking my learnings of Assembly and programming with it at any great length. This is really about the learning exercise. Perhaps I’ll find a use for it going forwards.


### My reasons for the basics of assembly
---
- Coming from a high-level language, I wanted to understand how things work at a lower level.
- To peel back the layers of mystery surrounding… well, everything!
- That’s it!
